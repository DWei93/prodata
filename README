Introduction
This is a parallel bulk data processing software, which can process the data of the molecular dynamics software LAMMPS and 
the discrete dislocation dynamics platform ParaDiS, the main functions include:
1. Weighted average of data for multiple tables;
2. Mechanical behavior Analysis of single extended dislocation in both DDD and MD simulations;
3. Generating various types of dislocation atomic geometric models in LAMMPS based on non-singular dislocation theory;
4. Parsing the data format of Tecplot software for complex and customized data processing;
5. Parsing the data format from LAMMPS.

Usage environment
1. c++11+ 
2. cmake 2.8+ 
3. gcc 7+

Install
mkdir build && cd build && cmake ../ -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=path/to/install/prodata && make -j install
